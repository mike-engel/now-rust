# now-rust changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.2.6

### New features

- Rust will be installed through a now lifecycle hook in `package.json` rather than by the builder [#5](https://github.com/mike-engel/now-rust/pull/5)

## 0.2.5

This is the initial release as a community-maintained repository. It includes all the existing data from the old official builder as well as the docs from the zeit builder page.

For previous version, please see the [official builder](https://github.com/zeit/now-builders) repo.
